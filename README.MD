# Página UM - Headless Wordpress App with NextJS

A modern blog application built with Next.js 14+, using WordPress as a headless CMS. It features a landing page, article pages (both statically generated) and an admin panel. The admin panel edits and saves a grid state to JSONbin and the landing page uses it to display the news stories/articles.
